Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of generative model introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. [1]  
How GANs Work 

1. Components: GANs consist of two neural networks that compete against each other: 
	• Generator (G): Creates fake samples (e.g., images or text) from random noise. 
	• Discriminator (D): Determines whether a given sample is real (from the training dataset) or fake (generated by the Generator). 

2. Training Process: The training of a GAN is analogous to a minimax game: 
	• The Generator aims to produce increasingly realistic fake samples to "fool" the Discriminator. 
	• The Discriminator strives to accurately distinguish between real and fake samples, effectively "catching" the Generator. 

3. Improvement Over Time: Through this adversarial process, the Generator progressively enhances its ability to create data that closely resembles the real training data, leading to the generation of realistic outputs. [1, 2]  


 Epochs -> increase, discriminator -> decreases, generator -> increase
The image describes the core concepts of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), including the roles of the Generator and Discriminator, the training process as a minimax game, and the mathematical objective function. [1, 2]  
1. The Generator: [2]  

• Takes random noise (e.g., a vector of 100 random numbers) as input. 
• Outputs a fake sample (e.g., an image or text). 

2. The Discriminator: [2]  

• Takes an input sample. 
• Predicts whether the sample is real (from training data) or fake (from the Generator). 

3. Training as a Minimax Game: [2]  

• Generator's role: Tries to "fool" the Discriminator by producing realistic-looking fake samples. 
• Discriminator's role: Tries to "catch" the Generator by accurately distinguishing between real and fake samples. 
• Over time, the Generator improves at producing more realistic data, making it harder for the Discriminator to distinguish between real and fake. 

4. Mathematical Idea (Training Objective): 

• The training objective is represented by the following minimax equation: 

$\min_{G} \max_{D} V(D, G) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{z}(z)}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))]$ 

• $D(x)$: Represents the probability that a real sample $x$ is classified as real by the Discriminator. [2]  
• $G(z)$: Represents the output of the Generator, which is a fake sample generated from random noise $z$. [2]  
• Objective: The Generator minimizes this value (to make fake samples more convincing), while the Discriminator maximizes it (to better distinguish real from fake). [2]  

5. Example Analogy: [2]  

• Counterfeit money game: This analogy helps visualize the GAN process. 
• Generator: Acts as a "fake money printer". 
• Discriminator: Acts as the "police" or "bank" trying to identify counterfeit money. 

The provided text outlines the conceptual workflow of how GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) generates text, emphasizing that it's a next-token prediction problem. The process involves three main steps: [1]  

• Tokenization: Input text is converted into smaller units called tokens (words, subwords, or characters), often using techniques like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE). 
• Embedding: Each token is then transformed into a dense numerical representation called a vector, enabling the model to process language mathematically. 
• Transformer Layers: GPT utilizes stacked transformer blocks, which incorporate self-attention mechanisms to determine the importance of previous tokens for predicting the next one, using queries, keys, and values to compute attention scores and capture long-range dependencies. 

The image outlines the evolution of text generation models, detailing their working mechanisms and limitations: 

• Rule-based: These models use pre-written templates and are limited by their lack of flexibility. 
• Statistical n-grams: These models predict the next word based on the previous 'n' words but struggle with handling long contexts. 
• RNN (Recurrent Neural Network): RNNs read sequences word by word but face challenges with long sentences due to the vanishing gradient problem. 
• LSTM/GRU: These are improved RNNs that incorporate memory gates, but they still have limitations in handling very long sequences. 
• Transformer (GPT): This model uses an attention mechanism to look at the entire sequence at once, making it very powerful, although it requires a huge amount of data for training. 



6. Transformer Architecture in Simple Terms
Key Components:
1. Embeddings - Convert tokens into vectors (mathematical representations).
2. Self-Attention - Lets each word look at other words in the sentence.
Example: In "The ball broke because it was fragile" → "it" refers to "ball."
3. Feed-forward layers - Process representations.
4. Output layer - Predicts next word probabilities.

8. Fine-tuning GPT
After pre-training, GPT can be fine-tuned on specific tasks:
Chatbots (dialogue fine-tuning)
Medical texts (healthcare GPTS)
Coding (Codex, GitHub Copilot)

The image describes different strategies for text generation and the role of "temperature" in controlling randomness: 

• Sampling Methods: Greedy Search, Random Sampling, Top-k Sampling, and Nucleus Sampling (Top-p) are techniques used to select the next word in text generation based on different criteria (likelihood, randomness, probability distribution). 
• Temperature in Text Generation: This parameter controls the randomness of the generated text. 
• Temperature Effects: Low temperature values (e.g., 0.2) lead to more deterministic and factual text, while high temperature values (e.g., 1.0) result in more creative and surprising output. 
• Text Generation Process: The overall process involves a prompt, tokenization, a model, and finally, a sampling method to choose the next token.
