Reinforcement Learning - learn to make decisions through trail and error 
Allows machines to learn by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback
Agent -> decision marker that performs action
Environment -> The world or sytem in which 
State -> The sitution or condition
Action -> possible moves
Reward -> feedback or result 

Policy -> A stratergy that the agent uses to determine the next action based on the current State
Reward Function : A function 
Value Function : feedback

Adusting Behavior

Positive Reinforcement : maximize performance and increase strength and frequency

Q learning

Model free reinforcemrnt learning
Best decisions by interacting with its environment

Q - table 
Q value  or Action Values (Expected rewards for taking an action in a specific state) -> Estimates how good it is to take a specific action 

Temporal Difference -> from experience 
Bellman's Equation


Rewards and Episodes
S ->current state
A -> Action
S' -> next state
A' -> Best
